C++ was indeed created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of the C programming language. The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in 1985.

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) was first released in 1987 as part of the GNU Project, which was initiated by Richard Stallman in 1983. The goal of the GNU Project was to create a free Unix-like operating system composed entirely of free software.

Before the creation of GCC, C++ programs were typically compiled using proprietary compilers provided by hardware vendors or software companies, which made it challenging for developers to write and distribute C++ programs across different systems.

While the GNU Project initially aimed to develop the GNU Hurd kernel as part of its operating system, the widespread adoption of the Linux kernel led to the integration of many GNU components, including GCC, the GNU C Library, and core utilities, into Linux-based operating systems.

A year after GNU GCC Compiler was created, GNU Project released GNU Make. GNU Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called makefiles. These makefiles specify how to derive the target program from the source files.

GNU Make generalizes the common parts of the GNU GCC compiling process by allowing users to specify the rules for compiling their programs in a common format using makefiles. These makefiles contain instructions for how to build the program, including the dependencies between different source files and the commands needed to compile them. This enables users to input the arguments and customize the build process according to their specific needs.

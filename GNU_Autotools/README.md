## Conclusion

In simple terms, GNU Autotools is a collection of tools that make it easier to build and install software projects. Autoconf helps us configure our project by detecting system features and dependencies. Automake generates the necessary Makefiles to build our project. Libtool helps manage shared libraries for better compatibility.

To truly understand Autotools, it's essential to practice and build a sample project on your own: [GNU_Autotools/SampleProjects/02_LocationService](https://github.com/nguyenchiemminhvu/CPP_Build_Toolchain/tree/master/GNU_Autotools/SampleProjects/02_LocationService)

I encourage you to take up the challenge and try building the sample project before seeking the [Solution]().

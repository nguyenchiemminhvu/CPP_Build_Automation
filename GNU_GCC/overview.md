## Introduction

C++ was indeed created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of the C programming language. The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in 1985.

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) was first released in 1987 as part of the GNU Project, which was initiated by Richard Stallman in 1983. The goal of the GNU Project was to create a free Unix-like operating system composed entirely of free software.

Before the creation of GCC, C++ programs were typically compiled using proprietary compilers provided by hardware vendors or software companies, which made it challenging for developers to write and distribute C++ programs across different systems.

While the GNU Project initially aimed to develop the GNU Hurd kernel as part of its operating system, the widespread adoption of the Linux kernel led to the integration of many GNU components, including GCC, the GNU C Library, and core utilities, into Linux-based operating systems.

GCC is a portable compiler, runs on most of platforms available today, produces output for many types of processors (x86_64, ARM, aarch64...).

GNU GCC is distributed under GNU GPL license (GNU General Public License), which means free to use, modify.

## Compiling a C/C++ program

Let's say we have a sample C++ program source code: [https://github.com/nguyenchiemminhvu/CPP_Build_Automation/blob/master/GNU_GCC/SampleProjects/HelloWorld/main.cpp](https://github.com/nguyenchiemminhvu/CPP_Build_Automation/blob/master/GNU_GCC/SampleProjects/HelloWorld/main.cpp)

### Compiling multiple source files

### Compiling files independently
#### Creating object files from source files

#### Creating executables from object files

### Using more compilation options
#### Adding search paths

#### Adding environment variables

#### Using preprocessors

#### Compiling for debugging

## Compiling a C/C++ library

### Compiling static library and link to C/C++ program

### Compiling shared object (dynamic library) and link to C/C++ program

## A sample project

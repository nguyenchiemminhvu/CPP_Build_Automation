## Introduction

In the vision of creating a complete free and open-source software ecosystem, led by Richard Stallman, after the creation of the GNU GCC Compiler in 1987, the GNU Project released GNU Make in 1988.

The GNU GCC Compiler was a great accomplishment as it provided a free and powerful tool to compile code. However, GNU Project realized that building software is not just all about compiling code.

Imagine you have a big project that consists of multiple files, like source code files, libraries, and other resources.

Now, building that project means taking all these pieces and putting them together in the right order to create the final executable file.

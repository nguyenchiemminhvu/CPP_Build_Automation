## Introduction

A year after GNU GCC Compiler was created, GNU Project released GNU Make. GNU Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles. These Makefiles specify how to derive the target program from the source files.

GNU Make generalizes the common parts of the GNU GCC compiling process by allowing users to specify the rules for compiling their programs in a common format using makefiles. These makefiles contain instructions for how to build the program, including the dependencies between different source files and the commands needed to compile them. This enables users to input the arguments and customize the build process according to their specific needs.
